## üíª Problem
Suppose the HR department of your company wants you to make a model to predict the salary of new employees based on the data they have on the company. The .csv file illustrates the data needed to train and test the model.
<br>
Find this problem in Kaggle : [rsadiq/salary](https://www.kaggle.com/rsadiq/salary)

<br>

## ‚úç Solution
Simple Linear Regression is being used to solve this problem. And it shows that the model predicts well to make future decisions for HR department to make the salary predictions based on the experience of the applicants.

The following graph shows the Salary vs Experience (Training Set).
